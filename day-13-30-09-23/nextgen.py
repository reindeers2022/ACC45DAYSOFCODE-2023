Chef is currently working for a secret research group called NEXTGEN. While the
rest of the world is still in search of a way to utilize Helium-3 as a fuel,
NEXTGEN scientists have been able to achieve 2 major milestones:

    Finding a way to make a nuclear reactor that will be able to utilize
    Helium-3 as a fuel
    Obtaining every bit of Helium-3 from the moon's surface

Moving forward, the project requires some government funding for completion,
which comes under one condition: to prove its worth, the project should power
Chefland by generating at least A units of power each year for the next B years.

Help Chef determine whether the group will get funded assuming that the moon has
X grams of Helium-3 and 1 gram of Helium-3 can provide Y units of power.
